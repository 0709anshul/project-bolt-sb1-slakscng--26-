  # Simplify RLS policies to bare minimum

  1. Changes
    - Remove all complex queries
    - Use simplest possible policy conditions
    - Eliminate all joins and subqueries
  
  2. Security
    - Maintain basic access control
    - Fix infinite recursion issues
    - Keep data properly protected
